# Advent of Code 2023

I am doing this, as started last year, to learn the Rust Programming language. I don't get to use it for work, so its nice to be able to stretch my coding muscles and try something new.

### New Day

`cargo new dayXX`
Copy bin folder from SampleDay.

### To Run

Navigate to correct day's bin folder
`cargo run --bin partX`

## To test

Navigate to day
`cargo test`
